Ultimately, I'm creating this password maker here based on my experience while learning JavaScript.

The user can first enter an alphabet from A to Z, which is a simple password. After that, he can enter a combination of alphabets and numbers, but the password is only moderately . However, if the user enters a combination of letters, numbers, and any special symbols, the entire password is regarded as strong 💪and cannot be stolen in the modern world.❤️
